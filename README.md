## Description
This project is that of a 2-Player 'Tic-Tac-Toe' game with the additions of dialogue(s) with limited user interactivity,
functioning counters that update in real time, a resizable Window (That does not break), and additional fluidity and
touch-ups so that the game works well--and does NOT have issues with both gameplay and rendering/display. Otherwise, if
time--and knowledge--were sufficient, additional elements would have been added. They say 'Shoot for the moon. Land
among the stars' but it could better be phrased as such: 'Shoot for the moon. Land face first--back to earthly reality.'

As stated, this project originally sought to accomplish rather 'high' goals (Player vs Computer, Tic-Tac, Falling Animation...)
but later dialed back to a more manageable--but still challenging and fulfilling--state. Regarding the many challenges faced,
those that I most want to emphasize are the Player vs Computer and Falling Animation aspects. Despite scouring many sources for
inspiration (i.e GeeksforGeeks, GitHub, Stack Overflow, Reddit, python-forum.io, ThePythonCode, et al...) I remained unable to
grasp the basic principle(s) required to make it work. Whereas the resources had given me a basic understand/insight on everything
from how to make the Window resizable (and not break and go black), events, and Global Variables as well as how to check for win
conditions without using a trillion 'If Statements'--here they are useless for the sole fact that much of the code is simply
beyond me and I lack the time to learn and understand their principles. Thus I decided on a 2-Player version and worked with what
I am most comfortable with as I knew that, with that, I would be able to produce a decent product. For the Falling
Animation the same logic is applied. Having sorely underestimated the difficulty of creating a working Tic-Tac-Toe, I was limited
on time for creating a falling animation. So I decided that it was not crucial to the 'identity' of my program, and scrapped it,
instead using that time to ensure there are no bugs, loops, or visual errors within the game. Truly, scope is a killer.

As for less major elements such as Tic-Tac (Patrick Star's nigh godly creation), it took all of--and more than--my alloted time 
to get the basic Tic-Tac-Toe working, and to do so for Tic-Tac would require 1.8x as much as code. However, with my newfound appreciation for the almighty Global Variable, I am confident that I could get it working given enough time. I did, however, have 
the time to add a win counter and round counter that updates on the display, lines that cross through the X's and O's (figures) for appeal, and additional dialogue and interactivity prior to the pygame display Window appearing. Thus I am not all too dissatisfied
with the program, especially since it was written in such a way that future alterations are easy and reading is legible.

Of what I am most proud of, it would be the fact that I was able to iron out any bugs, loops, an visual errors within the game,
as well as having managed to establish such a--in my opinion--strong 'base'. It is easy to understand and to edit, so in the
future, should I ever come back to this project folder, I would be able to implement new elements with newfound knowledge.
Another element that I am proud of is unrelating to the Tic-Tac-Toe display itself, but instead in the 'dialogue' as they help to
make the program feel less like a one-and-done Tic-Tac-Toe game, but rather more so like a gameshow. Lastly, I am quite pleased
with what I have learned. Whereas I went into this class's final lab with minimal understanding, I have finished this project
with a good understanding on pygame as well as a few miscellaneous points such as Global Variables, sys, events, Numpy, and arrays.

Overall I feel that I have benefited greatly from this project, even if it was frustrating at times given my initial scope. I can
take solace in the fact that, despite not 100% fulfilling my own past ambitions, I at least feel that I have fulfilled this
assignments expectations and executed my main objective with flourish at that.
